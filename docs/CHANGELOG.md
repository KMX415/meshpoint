# Changelog

### v0.5.4 (March 30, 2026)

- **MQTT gateway:** dual-protocol MQTT publishing for Meshtastic (protobuf ServiceEnvelope) and MeshCore (JSON). Publishes to community maps (meshmap.net, NHmesh.live) and Home Assistant. Two-gate privacy model: MQTT is off by default, and only public channel traffic is published unless you explicitly allowlist a private channel. Gateway ID branding (`!meshpoint-<name>`) attributes all data to your Meshpoint. Optional JSON mirror for HA/Node-RED, auto-discovery sensor configs, and configurable location precision.
- **Packet type filter (cloud):** filter the Meshradar cloud packet feed by type (traceroute, position, text, etc.) and protocol (Meshtastic/MeshCore). Dropdown filters in the packets tab header.
- **Setup wizard MQTT step:** `meshpoint setup` now includes an MQTT opt-in prompt with broker selection and HA integration toggle.

### v0.5.3 (March 31, 2026)

- **Multi-key decryption:** packets on private Meshtastic channels now decrypt when channel keys are configured in `local.yaml`. Previously only the default key was tried. ([#5](https://github.com/KMX415/meshpoint/issues/5))
- **Heartbeat optimization:** reduced upstream heartbeat interval for lower cloud costs.

### v0.5.2 (March 31, 2026)

- **Core module binary fix:** v0.5.1 shipped updated source but stale compiled `.so` files. This release includes the correctly compiled binaries.

### v0.5.1 (March 30, 2026)

- **Non-LongFast preset fix:** `ConcentratorChannelPlan.from_radio_config()` no longer ignores spreading factor and bandwidth when using the region's default frequency. EU_868 MediumFast (SF9/BW250), ShortFast, and other presets now work correctly. Previously, any preset at the default frequency was silently overridden to LongFast (SF11/BW250). ([#4](https://github.com/KMX415/meshpoint/issues/4))

### v0.5.0 (March 29, 2026)

- **Multi-region frequency support:** 6 Meshtastic regions (US, EU_868, ANZ, IN, KR, SG_923) with auto-tuning concentrator and setup wizard region selector.
- **Preset tuning:** service channel SF and BW are configurable via `local.yaml`. Supports MediumFast, ShortFast, ShortTurbo: not just LongFast.
- **Frequency override:** set `frequency_mhz` in `local.yaml` to tune to a non-default slot within your region.
- **Full portnum decoding:** position speed/heading/altitude, power metrics, routing errors, NEIGHBORINFO, TRACEROUTE payloads.
- **`meshpoint meshcore-radio` CLI:** switch MeshCore companion frequency without re-running the full wizard. Presets (US/EU/ANZ) or custom entry.
- **Startup banner accuracy:** boot log shows the actual radio config, not just the region default.
- **Config stability:** empty YAML sections no longer crash the service on startup.

### Earlier (March 2026)

#### Early March
- **Real-time packet streaming:** cloud dashboard receives packets instantly via WebSocket. Live animated lines trace packets from source nodes to your Meshpoint on the map.
- **Cloud map overhaul:** marker clustering, signal heatmap layer, topology lines from neighborinfo data, and a live Recent Packets ticker panel.
- **SenseCap M1 support:** auto-detects SenseCap M1 carrier board via I2C probe during setup. Flash an SD card and go.
- **14 Meshtastic portnums decoded:** TEXT, POSITION, NODEINFO, TELEMETRY, ROUTING, ADMIN, WAYPOINT, DETECTION_SENSOR, PAXCOUNTER, STORE_FORWARD, RANGE_TEST, TRACEROUTE, NEIGHBORINFO, MAP_REPORT, plus encrypted packet tracking.
- **Device role extraction:** node table shows CLIENT, ROUTER, REPEATER, TRACKER, SENSOR, and other roles from NodeInfo packets.
- **Smart relay engine:** deduplication, token-bucket rate limiting, hop/type/signal filtering, independent SX1262 TX path.

#### Mid March
- **Live dashboard UX:** color-coded packet feed, decoded payload contents, 24h active node counts, version-based update indicator, and enlarged map view.
- **Cloud dashboard tabs:** tabbed layout with fleet view, interactive map controls, device-scoped filters, unified packet cards with signal strength bars, and public activity stream for visitors.
- **MeshCore USB capture:** new capture source for USB-connected MeshCore companion nodes. Auto-detects the device, configures radio frequency via the setup wizard (US/EU/ANZ presets or custom), with auto-reconnect and health monitoring. Startup banner shows all active sources.
- **Custom frequency tuning:** configurable SX1302 channel plan via `local.yaml`. Validated on live hardware with LongFast (SF11/BW250). Dual-protocol HAL patch for simultaneous Meshtastic and MeshCore sync words.
